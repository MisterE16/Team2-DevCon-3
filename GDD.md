## Our Game Idea
A pong, [Insert theme] style game with simulated physics where the ball will be influenced by forces from the player’s paddles to the ground and ceiling. (this is a temporary placement for the idea that you can change)

It's the same as arcade pong, but instead of the ball being in “space” (no gravity), instead it will fall and hit the ground.
Project Statement/Project Goals
Implement a physics simulated twist on the original pong arcade game, influenced by metrics and forces. The project will blend the basis of pong with a dynamic physics system that intends to bring an enjoyable and engaging gameplay experience. 

## Our goals would be to:
Implement a physics based system that works with our pong game
Creating a theme that complements the game 
Making the game replayable, possibly with a scoring system (possible stretch goal) and from the unpredictability with physics being involved

## Design Rationale 
We believe a physics based “Pong” like game will enhance realism and add a layer of immersion within it. This is due to bounces, momentum, and speed adjustments that mimic real world behavior. Having an unpredictable version of Pong prevents repetition and allows players to adapt at a higher level of difficulty, which potentially creates an engaging experience with strong replayability.
